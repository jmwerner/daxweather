GoT Weather
============

Adapted from [VARUN WEATHER](https://github.com/michaeltli/varunweather), which was adapted from [DRAKE WEATHER](http://www.drakeweather.com). Upcoming modifications inspired by [DOGE WEATHER](http://www.dogeweather.com)!

# 2014-11-02 6PM update:
- Have been trying to adapt a simplified version of the changing text feature of Dogeweather's jQuery.dogeweather.js to create a GoT version of text that pops out. No success at making it appear. Will keep experimenting.
